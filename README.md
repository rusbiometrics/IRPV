# Image recogbition performance verification

This project seeks to identify which algorithms are most accurate at recognizing images collected in an unconstrained manner.

Here you can find:
 
 - nullImpl - dummy example of verification API interface implementation
 
 - irpv.h - header file that should be included as reference for verification API interface implementation
